## Features

## I need your help
I want the app to support as many audio formats ass possible. Rigth now it can read pretty much anything stanks to [music-metadata](https://github.com/Borewit/music-metadata), but only writes ID3 v2.2 and v2.3 tags in MP3 files, which is powered by [node-id3](https://github.com/Zazama/node-id3).

I am looking for your help to implement writing tags to more formats. If you find a package that can write to WAV, OGG or FLAC or want to make one please let me know or feel free to create a pull request with your own implementation.
